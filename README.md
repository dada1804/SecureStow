PHP requires the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017
MySQL requires the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013
It is important to note that, XAMPP is not designed for production use but for development environments and testing purposes.

2.To download and run Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on Windows, you will need the following system requirements:

Windows 7 or later (64-bit)
1.6 GHz or faster processor
1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)
64-bit version of Windows
Windows PowerShell 3.0 or higher
You will also need an internet connection to download the software and any updates.

Additionally, Visual Studio Code is based on Electron, an open-source framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Therefore, it also requires JavaScript runtime dependencies, such as Node.js and Chromium, which are included in the installation package.

You can download the Visual Studio Code installer from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once you have downloaded the installer, double-click on the .exe file to begin the installation process. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.


3.To run PHP code, you will need a web server with PHP installed. Some common web servers that support PHP include Apache and Nginx. You will also need a database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, if your PHP code requires access to a database. Additionally, you may need to install any PHP extensions that are required by your code, such as the MySQLi extension for working with MySQL databases.


4.HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code can be run in any web browser, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
To run JavaScript code, you will need a web browser that supports JavaScript, as JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that runs within the browser. HTML and CSS code does not require any specific dependencies to run, as they are simply markup languages used to create the structure and styling of a website.
You can also use a text editor or code editor to write and edit your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and then view it in a browser. Some popular code editors include Atom, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio Code.
Additionally, some JavaScript Frameworks and libraries like React, Angular or Vue.js may require additional dependencies but that would be specified in the project documentation.

A local web server (such as XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP) to serve the HTML and CSS files
A CSS preprocessor (such as Sass or Less) to process the Bootstrap source files (optional)
You will also need to download the Bootstrap package, which can be found on the official Bootstrap website (getbootstrap.com). You can download the compiled CSS and JavaScript files, or you can download the source code and compile it yourself.

Additionally, you can use a package manager like npm or yarn to install Bootstrap and its dependencies.

6.Launch the xampp server and type localhost/securestow/ url in the default browser.

You can use the command "unzip" on Linux and macOS.

Examples:

unzip file.zip
unzip file.zip -d destination_folder
On Windows, you can use the command "Expand-Archive" in PowerShell, or you can use a third-party software like 7zip or WinRar.
